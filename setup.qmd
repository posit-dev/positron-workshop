## Positron - Required

Since Positron is under rapid development, we recommend downloading and installing the latest release as close as possible to the date of your workshop.

Get the latest release at: <https://positron.posit.co/download.html>

Pre-releases are available at: <https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/releases>

## R - Required

Positron will detect your existing R installation, so if you have a recent version of R (> 4.2) installed, you don't need to do anything else.

If you don't have R installed, or need to update, follow the instructions for your operating system at <https://cloud.r-project.org/>.

You'll also need the following packages installed:

```{.r}
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "palmerpenguins", "usethis"))
```

## Git - Optional but recommended

Follow the instructions at <https://happygitwithr.com/install-git>.
