## Workflow

Preview the website locally with:

```bash
quarto preview
```

Modules need a landing page in `modules/` and a slide deck in `slides/`---these files should have the same slug. 
Use the `include` shortcode to include the slide deck on the landing page:

```markdown
{{< include _slides.md >}}
```

The rest of the landing page can be used for links, code, or other content you want easiy accessible to participants.
